# emacs.d

My .emacs.d config helping into my clojure journey :)

## Emacs Version
At home I am using Emacs 24.3.1 (`M-x version` "GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.20.1)
 of 2013-09-08 on debian")
In the office I am using GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, X toolkit, Xaw3d scroll bars) of 2013-10-17 on akazlou-ebuddy

## Disclaimer
While I'm learning (both Emacs and Clojure) I will improve my .emacs.d setup.

## Useful Keys
 - `C-h` (`m` - describe modes, `f` - describe function, `v` - describe
variable, `k` - describe key, `a` - search by phrase, `w` - shows the key shortcut for the command (alternative for `M-x where-is`), `b` - describing binding (how useful although it might be), `C-a` - show home page).

Found a wonderful new help combination, just press `C-h` after any already pressed key, for example, C-x and it will display all available shortcuts which start with this combination 
(see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2064094/keyboard-shortcut-completion-help-in-emacs).

## Interaction with lisp
`C-x C-e` evaluate last expr
